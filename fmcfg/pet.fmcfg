### TE of epi acquisition

epiTE=30  # ms

### EPI dwell time per phase-encode line -- same as effective echo spacing
# Scansheet: ep2d_BOLD_resting_320meas > Resolution > Accel. factor PE -- Not listed --- assume(!) 1
# Scansheet: ep2d_BOLD_resting_320meas > Sequence > Echo spacing

# From FSL documentation:
#  Effective EPI echo spacing is the time between echoes in successive k-space lines.
#  If you are using an accelerated sequence (parallel imaging) then the number you need here is the echo spacing 
#  for the acquired lines divided by the acceleration factor. 

GRAPPAAccel=1  # set to 1 if not an accelerated sequence

echoSpacing=0.95 # ms

### TEs of gre fieldmap magnitude images -- used to convert fieldmap to rad/s
# Siemens gradient echo fieldmaps acquire two images with different echo times. 
# The change in MR phase from one image to the other is proportional to both 
#    the field inhomogeneity in that voxel and the echo time difference. 
# The field value is therefore given by the difference in phase between
#    these two images divided by the echo time difference.

# Scansheet: gre_fieldmapping > Routine > TE1
# Scansheet: gre_fieldmapping > Routine > TE2

greTE1=4.92 # ms
greTE2=7.38 # ms

### Unwarp direction: i.e., the phase-encoding direction of the fMRI EPI sequence
# From FSL documentation:
#   The sign of this direction will depend on both the sign of the phase encode blips in the EPI sequence and on 
#   the sign of the fieldmap.  As it can be difficult to predict this sign when using a particular 
#   site/scanner/sequence for the first time, it is usual to try both positive and negative values in turn and 
#   see which gives better undistortion (the wrong sign will increase the amount of distortion rather than 
#   decrease it).

# update 20170410 with "COL" and "ROW" dicom header
# Scansheet: ep2d_BOLD_resting_320meas > Routine > Phase enc. dir. # "COL" A>>P 
# Scansheet: gre_field_mapping > Routine > Phase enc. dir. # "ROW"  R>>L

# Signal loss threshold: Determines where the signal loss in the EPI is too great
# for registration to get a good match between the EPI data and other images. 
# Areas where the % signal loss in the EPI exceeds this threshold will get masked out of 
# the registration process between the EPI and the fieldmap and structural images.

signallossthresh=0.9 # Areas with 90% or more signal loss in fieldmap are masked out
